## 1. Introduction

Boardwise is a comprehensive platform designed to digitise and expand the board game experience for enthusiasts, particularly within the South African market. The South African board gaming community remains largely offline and fragmented; local stores host gaming days, but enthusiasts are often tied to specific retail locations to find community. Boardwise centralises this ecosystem, providing a store-agnostic platform where the community can connect, rent, and organise events independently.

The platform addresses key community problems: enabling peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions (rental and sale) without dependence on a single retailer, fostering community formation through groups and events, and democratising access to board game knowledge through a collaboratively maintained shared library of rulebooks.

**Scope Note:** This document reflects the requirements in scope for **Sprint 1 (Demo 1)**. The focus is on delivering a functional MVP with core CRUD capabilities across all system domains. The following features are explicitly deferred to future sprints and are **not covered** by this document: personalised recommendation systems, RAG-based natural language query interface, PWA installability, Generative Game Architect (AI Innovation), Setup Wizard, app theming, price comparison, and automated retrieval of rulebooks from the internet.
